# Nikko Rey Hular
I'm a Front End Web Developer career shifter, with a background as a Architectural Draftsman for 8 years.

I enjoy building digital products that either solve problems or entertain people. Preferrably in HTML CSS & Javascript

I'm self driven, hard working and easy going.

## Education & Certifications:
### Team TreeHouse - Front End Developer Techdegree

### Free Code Camp - Responsive Website

## Projects I've coded:
### An Online Registration Form
For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I had to build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.

### Build a Mobile-first Responsive Layout
For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I was given three image mockups for a mobile, tablet, and desktop layout. I had to match the designs perfectly, where I had to write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I had to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

### An Interactive Photo Gallery
For this project I had to create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos were provided with descriptions for me to implement as project material. At the top of the page, I had to include a search area where photos hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. The photo gallery also needed to be consist of back and previous arrows to allow users to cycle through photos.
